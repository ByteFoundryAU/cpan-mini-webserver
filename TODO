Things that we want to do

* Make sure all patches/commits are reformatted using perltidy and
  the .perltidyrc in this directory

Hide POD errors
Pick new default port, 8080 is too common
Pass different port number in ARGV
Have a generic error page, and push all errors to it
Fix links in POD to go back to us
Fix package links to go to a best-guess filename
Fix tests to fail unless there is a mirror
Write OpenSearch plugin:

Maybe use LWP::Online and gravatar? 
Improve searching - maybe use KinoSearch?

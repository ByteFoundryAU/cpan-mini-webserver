Things that we want to do

* Make sure all patches/commits are reformatted using perltidy and
  the .perltidyrc in this directory

Have a generic error page, and push all errors to it
Reload indexes if the indexes have updated

Maybe use LWP::Online and gravatar? 

Ideas from Max Maischein:

- (general)
 * Make error message for missing ~/.minicpanrc clearer
 * Write some tests for the new functionalities

- (general)
 * Make the start page have links to "categories", like "XML modules"
   etc. - this could be a (hand|community)-vetted list later but for
   the start these links should just be predefined searches
   for "XML", "DBI", "CGI".
 * Consider listing "Web frameworks". Later.
 * An empty search string causes an error.

- (mirror) Mini CPAN Mirror Status page
 * Show time of mirror
 * Alert if mirror is older than a week (or month? Configurable?)
 * "Update" link to launch C<minicpan> and update the mirror

- (maintenance) Mini CPAN installed modules page
 * List (all, paged) installed modules with links to local minicpan
 * Version status of every module
 * "Upgrade" button
 * "Upgrade all" button (dangerous, but what the hell)

- (maintenance)
 * Redirect CPAN.pm/Makefile.PL STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR to web

Ideas from Mark Fowler:

- Be able to use the webserver from a remote computer as a standard
CPAN mirror
- Make p3rl.org short url paths work and 302 to the right place

After that I had a laundry list of other features:

- example init.d and launchd scripts
- ability to detect that the index files have updated on disk and
reload the indexes
- Render local perldoc (perlfunc chunks, perltoot, perltie, etc)
- Add links to search / rt / anno / etc from the module page
- 'AJAX' Autocompletion in the searchbar
- Indication if this module (and what version) is installed on the
machine running the webserver

Things that we want to do

* Make sure all patches/commits are reformatted using perltidy and
  the .perltidyrc in this directory

Pick new default port, 8080 is too common
Pass different port number in ARGV
Have a generic error page, and push all errors to it
Fix links in POD to go back to us
Only index with KinoSearch if minicpan has changed


Maybe use LWP::Online and gravatar?
